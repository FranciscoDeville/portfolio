It was conceived as an ecommerce of tourist packages where the client has a wide range of packages to tour Argentina, in addition to various types of filtering and a cart with a payment gateway to buy a package. Once the trip is over, you have the possibility to leave a review of the hotel, activities carried out and transportation service. On the administrator's side, you have the possibility to create, edit and delete any type of services that are in the packages, you can also create the packages in a very easy and intuitive way. It also has the possibility of 'banning' a user and/or deleting a comment if it is inappropriate.",
